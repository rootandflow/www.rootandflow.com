description: Media objects are super useful components for displaying an item, usually an image, alongside some content, usually text. You could put lists, grids, or even other media objects inside.
code:
  javascript:
  html: |
    <div class="media-object">
      <div class="media-object-section">
        <img src= "http://placeimg.com/200/200/people">
      </div>
      <div class="media-object-section">
        <h4>Dreams feel real while we're in them.</h4>
        <p>I'm going to improvise. Listen, there's something you should know about me... about inception. An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.</p>
