title: Tooltip
description: Tooltips? More like <em>Cooltips</em>. But really though, tooltips are nifty for displaying extended information for a term or action on a page.
code:
  javascript:
  html: |
    <p>The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover='false' tabindex=1 title="Fancy word for a beetle.">scarabaeus</span> hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet. Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree.</p>
