If I make a website for a client and all the coding is original work
 and I sell them a non-exclusive license to use the material in their business,
 would they be allowed to modify the source code in the future,
 or even have another developer come in and modify it for them,
 or is this only something they can do if they pay extra
 for the exclusive license?

## Know What Your Options Are

 This article is intended as a guide -- it is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
Please note that I am _not_ a lawyer or legal professional.
My aim is to provide you with a high level understanding of how copyright law offers certain options for distrbuting your content.
We'll take a broad strokes look at how content licensing is structured.
This way you will know what options are available to you when investing in content creation and how to protect your content for your continued use -- including what legal services you'll need as your business grows. 

## Know Your Rights  

From the [Digital Media Law Project][legal-guide]:  

> "A license is a grant of permission to exercise your rights under copyright...  
>
> + When you give someone a **non-exclusive license**, you give the licensee permission to exercise the right in question, but you also reserve the right to continue exercising it yourself and to authorize others to do so.  
> + When you give someone an **exclusive license**, you promise that the licensee and only the licensee may exercise the right. This means that when you grant an exclusive license, _even **you may not** exercise the granted right_, nor may you authorize anyone else to do so.  
>
> (emphasis mine)  

So a license means you retain ownership of copyright even though another party is now authorized to act as the owner of the copyright.    

An exclusive licensing agreement differs from a non-exclusive one in that it limits **you** -- the orginal copyright owner of the work -- from licensing the work to anyone else. Presumably you would charge a hefty premium for this legal guarantee to the client that they are the only party with the legal right to use the work -- even you have given up the right to use the work for the duration of the agreement, though you do retain ownership of the copyright throughout.  

Whether exclusive or non-exclusive, licensing your work to the client without restriction means they have permission to use it _as they see fit_, including modifying it, bringing in another developer to build on it, etc.  

You may however [limit rights](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/which-rights-can-be-transferred-or-licensed) licensed in an agreement. As an example, when I deliver a web site design to a client do so under a limited license. The client is granted the right to use the design work for only _one_ business -- the one I was contracted to design for. They are **not** permitted to copy/paste the design with altered content to market another business.  

Conversely, the client may negotiate a limited exclusive license with my firm -- for instance that I will not sell the same or similar design to a competitor within their market and region. Again, this is something for which I would charge a premium. The client is paying for a competitive advantage.    

Regarding the specifics of your question, as stated in Section 106 of the Copyright Act you _**can**_ limit

in your copyright agreement. However you should be up front and make sure the client knows and understands this before signing documents.

Also ask yourself why you feel this is necessary for you, and how this serves the best interests of your clients. There are other avenues you can pursue that will lead to repeat business for yourself and a better end result for your clients.
