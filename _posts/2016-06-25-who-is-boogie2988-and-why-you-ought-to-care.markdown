## Up For Grabs: 3 Million Subscribers

 Twenty thousand YouTube creators and fans filled Anaheim Convention Center this June for the [7th annual Vidcon][vidcon-wiki].  

![Only one of Boogie's 15 most popular videos was posted less then 2 years ago.][boogie-vids-image]

 Unfortunately not all of the news coming out of VidCon was glad tidings. 
Popular YouTuber Boogie2988 reported his [YouTube channel was hacked][boogie-reddit] this weekend. 
Locked out of his own channel, he was forced to communicate the following to his fans via a post on reddit:  

> Hey guys. Boogie here.  
Looks like we got hacked again. Someone manage to steal my phone number and used it to gain access to everything.  
We are working now to get everything back up and running. Channel should be back in a few days.  
Until you see a video from me explaining we got everything back please don't trust any links or anything I post anywhere on any social media including here!  
Love you guys! We are going to go enjoy the rest of vidcon!  
So what's the problem?  

## Bad Things Happen

Fortunately it appears Boogie has regained control of his YouTube channel without suffering any permenant loss or damage to his video properties.  

_But what if that wasn't the case?_  

 What if the hacker made use of unrestricted access to Boogie's account to delete videos from Boogie's channel?  

 Let's say, hypothetically, Boogie's most popular video was deleted.  
 How bad could it be?  

 The awful truth is Boogie's recovery options in such a situation are limited to nonexistant.  

### Caveat

It's impossible to know how much ad revenue any particular YouTube video generates for a channel owner. "Ad revenues vary wildly, based on the time of the year, the compatibility of the product with the channel, and so on" states Geoffrey Reemer, a Certified YouTube Audience Growth Expert.  

"Still, as a really, really rough rule of thumb," he [explains][30m-equals-30k-quora] "you can work with $1 to $2 per 1,000 views. So people with 30M views per month generate at least $30,000 to $60,000 a month. And that's a very conservative estimate, because often times, it's much more."  

### What's At Stake

 Boogie's [most popular video][splash-vid] currently sits at just under 30 million views. 
Published 4 years ago, it has accumulated over 28 thousand user comments and 88 thousand thumbs up likes over its lifetime.  

 It's true that Boogie could re-upload the same video content to YouTube. 
But replacing the lost video will see: 

  + Its view count reset from 30 million to **zero**. 
  + Every single Thumbs-Ups irretrievably lost.  
  + All of those tens of thousands of user comments unreproducibly lost.  

This means the social signals accumulated over the lifetime of the original video property effectively evaporate -- _they're gone forever_.  

Without those social signals the replacement video will fail to rank in YouTube's recommendation algorithms. 
new views on the property plummet.  

Boogie sees his most popular video -- his top asset for earning ad revenue on his channel -- effectively flatline.  

### How It Gets Even Worse

The damage does not end with the direct loss of one or more deleted videos. 
It ripples out and harms the channel as a whole.  

Deleting a video from YouTube _breaks every single inbound link_ to that video. 
Channel creators are often shocked to discover it is **impossible** to redirect YouTube video url addresses 
Once they're gone, they're gone, along with all of the inbound traffic those links bring from external websites to a Youtube creator's channel.  

Losing all those views is unfortunate -- losing all of those potential new subscribers is a catastrophe. 
Subscribers bring consistent views over the long term.  

## The Bottom Line 

What is certain is that building a YouTube channel is a front-loaded endeavor. 
The goal may be direct ad revenues or long term audience aggregation. 
Like saving for retirement with a 401k account, it takes years of up-front expenditures before seeing a steady return that outstrips expense.  

But also like diversified retirement savings portfolio, once you've built it up, the compounding nature of the investment generates value that crosses the threshold into self-sustainability. 
The exponential nature of the rewards make the early costs more than worth the effort.

### The Unfortunate Truth

Any individual or brand organization failing to secure access to social media platforms and other digital assets is playing with fire.  

Who wants to watch all of their long-term efforts -- all of their hard work -- go up in smoke?
